The requires for this project work when it lives at the top level of the waves source.

E.g.
  
  waves/
    bin/
    doc/
    lib/
->  metrics/ <-
    samples/
    templates/
    test/

The Stevedore benchmarking tool/toy uses rsruby, so you'll need to install R, tell your shell where R_HOME is, and install the rsruby gem.

As the rsruby gem uses a C extension, this is problematic.

I need to consider shelling out to R for the power.t.test.  A pure Ruby lib could do the stddev calc.

$ /user/bin/R --slave -e 'power.t.test(power=0.9, delta=0.0001, sd=0.001133, sig.level=0.01)["n"]'
